title: "Aleut suffixal adjectives and head movement"
collection: recent

Aleut nominals can be modified by what I have termed "suffixal adjectives", which appear between the noun stem and case/number morphology.

1. hla-kucha-x̂
   boy-little-ABS.sg
   `the little boy'
   
However, under certain conditions, these suffixal adjectives can appear deep within the morphology of verbs, between the stem and tense.

In my first qualifying paper, I analyze these suffixal adjectives as adjuncts to NP, but also argue that they are undergoing head movement to appear within the verbal complex. Specifically, I show how a particular interpretation of [Harizanov & Gribanova (2019)](https://web.stanford.edu/~gribanov/downloads/Harizanov-Gribanova-2019.pdf">Harizanov & Gribanova (2019)'s)'s "amalgamation" can grant head movement from adjunct positions, thus producing words as in (2b).

See this link for the full paper, currently in review at NLLT.
