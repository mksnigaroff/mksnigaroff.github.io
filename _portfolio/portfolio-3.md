title: "Aleut suffixal adjectives and head movement"
collection: recent
---

Aleut nominals can be modified by what I have termed "suffixal adjectives", which appear between the noun stem and case/number morphology.

1. hla-**kucha**-x̂ \
   boy-**little**-ABS.sg \
   `the little boy'
   
However, under certain conditions, these suffixal adjectives can appear deep within the morphology of verbs, between the stem and tense.

2. Hla-**kucha**-x̂ mika-ku-x̂. \
   boy-**little**-ABS.sg play-PRES-3.sg \
   'The little boy is playing.'
   
| 2. | a. | Hla-**kucha**-x̂        | mika-ku-x̂.     |
| -- | -- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
|    |    | boy-**little**-ABS.sg  | play-PRES-3.sg |

In my first qualifying paper, I analyze these suffixal adjectives as adjuncts to NP, but also argue that they are undergoing head movement to appear within the verbal complex. Specifically, I show how a particular interpretation of [Harizanov & Gribanova (2019)](https://web.stanford.edu/~gribanov/downloads/Harizanov-Gribanova-2019.pdf)'s "amalgamation" can grant head movement from adjunct positions, thus producing words as in (2b).

See this link for the full paper, currently in review at NLLT.
