Aleut nominals can be modified by what I have termed ``suffixal adjectives", which appear between the noun stem and case/number morphology.

However, under certain conditions, these suffixal adjectives can appear deep within the morphology of verbs, between the stem and tense.

In my first qualifying paper, I analyze these suffixal adjectives as adjuncts to NP, but also argue that they are undergoing head movement to appear within the verbal complex. Specifically, I show how a particular interpretation of Harizanov & Gribanova (2019)'s ``amalgamation" can grant head movement from adjunct positions, thus producing words as in (2b).
