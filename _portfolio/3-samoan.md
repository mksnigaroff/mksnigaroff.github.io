*(elicitation materials for scopal ambiguities)*

This project centers on the little-understood semantic distinction between the Samoan articles *le* and *se*, historically characterized as the specific and non-specific articles. I show that the distinction between these two articles is much more complicated than any traditional notion of ``specificity". Read my qualifying paper on the topic [here](https://mksnigaroff.github.io/files/2023SamoanManuscript.pdf), as well as a presentation at AFLA 32 here.
