*(elicitation materials for scopal ambiguities)*

This project centers on the little-understood semantic distinction between the Samoan articles *le* and *se*, historically characterized as the specific and non-specific articles. In my second qualifying paper, I show how the distinction is much more complicated than one of specificity. Read the manuscript [here](https://mksnigaroff.github.io/files/2023SamoanManuscript.pdf). This project is ongoing; comments are welcome!
