*(elicitation materials for scopal ambiguities)*

This project centers on the little-understood semantic distinction between the Samoan articles *le* and *se*, historically characterized as the specific and non-specific articles. I show that the distinction between these two articles is much more complicated than any traditional notion of ``specificity". This work was presented at the 32nd Austronesian Formal Linguistics Association as a presentation (AFLA 32) (see my presentation [here](https://mksnigaroff.github.io/files/Snigaroff%202025%20presentation%20-%20Revisiting%20Samoan%20'specificity'.pdf)), and will appear in the AFLA 32 proceedings (preprint [here](https://mksnigaroff.github.io/files/Snigaroff%202025%20-%20Revisiting%20'specificity'%20-%20An%20alternative%20semantics%20account%20for%20Western%20Samoan.pdf)).
