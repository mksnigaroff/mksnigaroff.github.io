Aleut is a critically endangered (<100 speakers) language originating from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. Today, Aleuts live in diaspora, and no L1 speakers of Aleut have been produced for at least two generations. I have been working with the Aleut community on a language revitalization project based off of the [Where Are Your Keys](https://whereareyourkeys.org/) method for about five years, and am committed to doing so for as long as the foreseeable future, as it is my own heritage language.

Language revitalization in the Aleut community has involved teaching, learning, monolingual elicitation from speakers, developing curricula, and general community-building activities. See [here](https://github.com/mksnigaroff/mksnigaroff.github.io/blob/bd9f816b6681263391c903d23068a58c2b51facd/files/Constructing%20Language%20Revitalization%20Resources%20-%20The%20Niigugim%20Tunuu%20Picture%20Dictionary.pdf) for my undergraduate honors thesis on constructing pedagogical materials in a revitalization-specific environment.
