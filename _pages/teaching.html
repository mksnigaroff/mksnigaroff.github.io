<p>Courses I've taught, including the schools they were designed for and a sample syllabus:</p>

<p><a href = "https://mksnigaroff.github.io/files/UAA%20AKNS%20A101I%20Syllabus.pdf"><b>Elementary Unangam Tunuu I</b></a> &ensp;
<i>University of Alaska, Anchorage</i> &ensp;
This course teaches beginning-level <i>Unangam Tunuu</i> (Aleut language), with a focus on <i>Niig&#770;ug&#770;im Tunuu</i> (Western Aleut). It is designed
  for students with little to no experience with Unangam Tunuu. By the end of the course, students will be able to ask <i>who</i>, <i>what</i>, <i>where</i>,
  <i>from where</i>, and <i>how</i> questions, have basic conversations, give an introduction of themselves and their families, and play a game of Go Fish.
  Students will also learn about the history of the Aleutian Islands, the language, dialectical differences, and ongoing revitalization efforts.

<i>University of Alaska, Anchorage</i> &ensp;
This is the second part of the Elementary Unangam Tunuu series, which focuses on the basics of the Aleut language (<i>Unangam Tunuu</i>) from the perspective of 
  Western Aleut (<i>Niig&#770;ug&#770;im Tunuu</i>). Students will expand their abilities to talk about their lives, discussing their preferences, hobbies, 
  and work, and describing the things around them in more detail. Students will learn about Aleut grammar in greater depth, with particular attention paid to 
  expanding the verb to derive new meanings from root words. Students will additionally learn to navigate Bergslandâ€™s (1997) <i>Aleut Grammar</i>, as well as
  other available resources, and will familiarize themselves with the culture and historical activities of the people of the Aleutians (the <i>Unangas</i> or
  <i>Unangan</i>). Finally, students will hone their skills with regular practice conversation, listening comprehension, and writing and reading exercises.
