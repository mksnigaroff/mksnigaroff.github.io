<p>Courses I've taught, including the schools they were designed for and a sample syllabus:</p>

<p><a href = "https://mksnigaroff.github.io/files/UAA%20AKNS%20A101I%20Syllabus.pdf"><b>Elementary Unangam Tunuu I</b></a> &ensp;
<i>University of Alaska, Anchorage</i> &ensp;
This course teaches beginning-level <i>Unangam Tunuu</i> (Aleut language), with a focus on <i>Niig&#770;ug&#770;im Tunuu</i> (Western Aleut). It is designed
  for students with little to no experience with Unangam Tunuu. By the end of the course, students will be able to ask <i>who</i>, <i>what</i>, <i>where</i>,
  <i>from where</i>, and <i>how</i> questions, have basic conversations, give an introduction of themselves and their families, and play a game of Go Fish.
  Students will also learn about the history of the Aleutian Islands, the language, dialectical differences, and ongoing revitalization efforts.
