I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in the Linguistics Department at the University of Chicago interested, broadly, in theoretical syntax, semantics, language revitalization, and fieldwork.

I did my undergrad at Stanford University, where I was advised by Paul Kiparsky on my thesis on creating pedagogical materials for a critically endangered Alaska Native language (Aleut). My first qualifying paper at the University of Chicago pertains to head movement and adjunction structures in that same endangered language, and I am currently working on my second qualifying paper, which analyzes the semantics of what has been called "specificity" in the Samoan article system.
